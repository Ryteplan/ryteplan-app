        <p>At RytePlan, the privacy of our users and the security of their information are paramount. This policy outlines the methods by which we safeguard, utilize, and disclose the data we gather about our user base.</p>
        <p>This policy is applicable to all websites owned and operated by us, along with all embedded features and functionalities. This includes our online and mobile applications, and any other services we may currently or subsequently offer, such as online training programs. Throughout this document, these are collectively referred to as our "Services."</p>
        <p>When we refer to "Personal Data," we mean: (i) information that can directly identify you as an individual, such as your name, email address, postal code, graduation date, and the names of educational institutions you attend or apply to; (ii) anonymized information derived from the usage of our Services and the characteristics and activities of users, from which all personal identifiers have been removed; and (iii) aggregated and anonymized data that cannot be linked back to any personally identifiable information.</p>
        <p>We may periodically update this policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. These updates may involve modifications, deletions, or additions to the existing terms. While we will strive to inform you via email of any significant changes, we are not responsible for any failure to do so. If any future alteration to this policy is unacceptable to you or results in your non-compliance, you must cease using the Services immediately. Your continued access or use of the Services following any revisions to this policy will be considered your acceptance of all such changes.</p>

        <h2 class="text-h5 mt-4 mb-2">Our Methods of Collecting Personal Data</h2>
        <p>When you interact with our website, we collect Personal Data about you to understand your identity and to customize our Services to your needs. Our data collection methods are categorized as follows:</p>
        <ul class="pl-5 mt-2">
          <li><strong>Account Holder Information:</strong> When you register for an account on our website to access our Services, we require you to specify your user type (e.g., student, parent, counselor, teacher, admissions representative) and associated organization (e.g., high school or college). You will also be asked to provide your full name, email address, organization of employment or school of attendance, and a password. If you are a student user, we may also request your birthdate and high school graduation date for identity verification purposes. While providing this information is optional, it may limit your access to or ability to utilize certain features of the Services.</li>
          <li><strong>Device and Connection Details:</strong> We automatically gather certain Personal Data when you visit our websites or utilize our Services, such as your IP address, device type, operating system, and browser type. We also collect data on your navigation within our websites and Services, including the pages you view, the links you click, and the duration of your service usage. The extent of this collection depends on the settings and type of device you use to access the Services. This Personal Data helps us gain insights into how you interact with our Services, enabling us to continuously improve your experience, for example, by personalizing the content displayed to you.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:</strong> We may also collect Personal Data through the use of cookies and similar tracking mechanisms. A cookie is a small text file placed on your device when you visit our websites. We may employ both persistent cookies (which remain on your hard drive for an extended period) and session ID cookies (which expire upon browser closure). Additionally, we might use other tracking technologies like web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels" or "clear GIFs") and local storage. These are small graphic files containing a unique identifier that allows us to recognize when someone has visited our websites or opened an email we have sent. We utilize a variety of cookies and tracking information to personalize your experience with our Services based on your behavior and preferences, and to conduct analytics that help us enhance our features, content, and site navigation. Specifically, we use cookies to enable the following features and functionalities on or through our websites and Services:
            <ul class="pl-5 mt-2">
              <li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> Employs cookies to analyze user interaction with our websites and Services. Its Demographics and Interest Reporting features collect visitor data such as age, gender, and interests. We use this data to better understand our users' profiles and behaviors, allowing us to improve our service offerings and related communications.</li>
              <li><strong>ZenDesk:</strong> Enables us to identify you when you create a support ticket, access our help center, or engage in live chat with our support team.</li>
              <li><strong>HubSpot:</strong> Allows us to personalize your interactions and the communications you receive from us.</li>
              <li><strong>Filepicker.io:</strong> Simplifies the process of uploading documents for use within our Services.</li>
              <li><strong>Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Instagram:</strong> Serve as platforms through which we engage with users and assess the effectiveness of our Services, communications, and marketing campaigns.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>If you prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers provide options to: (i) notify you when a cookie is received, allowing you to decide whether to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) automatically reject cookies. Depending on your mobile device and operating system, you may not be able to delete or block all cookies. While we are committed to respecting your privacy preferences, our systems are currently unable to respond to web browsers' "do not track" signals, which aim to allow users to opt out of the collection of their browsing activity, as no uniform standard for "do not track" has been established.</li>
        </ul>

          <li><strong>Anonymized User Data:</strong> We may share Personal Data in an aggregated and anonymized format that does not allow for the reasonable identification of any individual.

          <li><strong>Legal Requirements and Enforcement of Terms:</strong> We may be required to disclose Personal Data to law enforcement or other third parties when mandated by court order or other legal processes, to comply with applicable laws or regulations, to enforce our Terms of Service, or if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of our users.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-h5 mt-4 mb-2">Our Policy Toward Children</h2>
        <p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of children, particularly in the online environment. Our website and Services are not designed for or directed at children, and individuals under the age of 13 are prohibited from using our Services. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age or, for residents of countries within the European Union, children under the age of 16 without obtaining verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child in violation of this policy, we will take commercially reasonable steps to delete that information from our records. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that their child has provided us with personal information without their consent, they should contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:it@ryteplan.com">it@ryteplan.com</a></p>

        <h2 class="text-h5 mt-4 mb-2">Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take the security of your Personal Data very seriously. We implement a multi-layered approach involving physical, technological, and administrative safeguards designed to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access. However, despite these measures, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized individuals will not gain access to your Personal Data. Please be aware that when using our Services, your Personal Data may travel through third-party infrastructures that are not under our direct control. If you receive an email requesting you to update your personal information, please do not reply and contact us directly at <a href="mailto:it@ryteplan.com">it@ryteplan.com</a></p>

        <h2 class="text-h5 mt-4 mb-2">International Data Transfers (for Non-U.S. Citizens)</h2>
        <p>Our primary data storage is on servers located and operated within the United States. If you access or use our Services from outside the United States, your Personal Data may be transferred to and stored in the United States. Consequently, the collection and use of your Personal Data are subject to the privacy and data protection laws of the United States, which may differ from and be less protective than the laws of your country of residence. By accepting the terms of this policy, you acknowledge, agree to, and consent to (i) the transfer and processing of your Personal Data on servers located outside your country of residence; (ii) our collection and use of your Personal Data as described herein and in accordance with the laws of the United States; and (iii) the potential risks associated with using our Services.</p>

        <h2 class="text-h5 mt-4 mb-2">Modifying or Deleting Your Personal Data</h2>
        <p>You have the right to review, update, correct, or request the deletion of your Personal Data (unless retention is required by law or for legitimate business reasons). This right may be limited if the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the privacy risks in question, or if it would infringe upon the rights of others. You can delete your account at any time through the Account Settings in your Profile section. Upon account deletion, we will mark your account as "Closed" in our database but may retain your account information for a limited period to comply with our archival and retention policies, deter fraud by preventing individuals who attempt fraudulent activities from evading detection by closing and reopening accounts, and as required by law. If you close your account, your personally identifiable information will not be used by us for any further purposes or shared with third parties, except when necessary to prevent fraud, assist law enforcement, as legally required, or as outlined in this Privacy Policy. For assistance with deleting your account, please contact us at <a href="mailto:it@ryteplan.com">it@ryteplan.com</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="text-h5 mt-4 mb-2">Data Retention</h2>
        <p>The duration for which we retain your Personal Data depends on the type of data. We will retain your Personal Data in accordance with generally accepted data retention policies and best practices for as long as we maintain a relationship with you and for a subsequent period where we have a legitimate, ongoing business need to do so. After this period, we will ensure your Personal Data is either deleted or anonymized.</p>

        <h2 class="text-h5 mt-4 mb-2">Data Breach Notification</h2>
        <p>In the event of a security breach where unauthorized access to our users' Personal Data occurs, we will notify affected users and relevant authorities within 72 hours of discovering the incident. If we are acting as a processor of your Personal Data on behalf of an educational institution, this notification will be provided to that institution.</p>

        <h2 class="text-h5 mt-4 mb-2">Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have specific rights regarding the processing of your Personal Data, as described below. In certain situations, we may not be able to fully accommodate your requests, or we may need to ask for additional information, including Personal Data, to verify your identity or the nature of your request. In such cases, we will still respond to inform you of our decision.</p>
